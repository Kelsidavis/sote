# Wine Execution Test Results for Enhanced SOTE_RE.exe

## Test Configuration
- **Executable:** `/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/build/bin/SOTE_RE.exe`
- **Hash:** `df51483219c0d13ce702aaee6df5999c1f9a12e0dfde2f6848890ab963e1627a`
- **Size:** 630,064 bytes
- **Test Date:** 2025-09-13

## Environment Variables Set
- `SOTE_ASSETS_DIR="/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/Sdata"`
- `SOTE_DISCLESS="1"`
- `SOTE_FORCE_SDL="1"`
- `SOTE_SHOW_SPLASH="1"`
- `SOTE_MENU_AUTONAV="1"`
- `SDL_AUDIODRIVER="dummy"`
- Various `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` settings tested

## Test Results

### Key Findings

1. **Application Startup:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL
   - Main entry point reached correctly
   - Environment variables detected and parsed
   - SDL routing path forced as expected
   
2. **SDL Routing:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL
   - `[ROUTE] SOTE_FORCE_SDL=1 detected - forcing SDL path`
   - `[ROUTE] forcing SDL path (disc-less)`
   - `[STARTUP] disc-less SDL loop begin`

3. **SDL Video Initialization:** ❌ FAILED
   - Consistent error: `[ERROR] SDL video init failed: 1`
   - Tested with multiple SDL video drivers:
     - `windows`: SDL init error code 1
     - `dummy`: SDL init error code 1
     - `x11`: "x11 not available"
     - Default (auto-detect): SDL init error code 1
     - Software renderer: SDL init error code 1

4. **Partial Success with X11 Driver:**
   - When forced to use X11, the program continued despite video failure
   - Audio initialization also failed but continued
   - Enhanced title sequence started: `[LOOP] Enhanced SDL title sequence start, splash=800ms, title=5000ms`
   - Renderer errors occurred repeatedly: `[CLEAR] ERROR: No renderer available`

## Log Evidence

### Successful Route Detection
```
[STARTUP] main() entry - argc=1, argv=0035bcd0 (SDL2 signature)
[STARTUP] SOTE_ASSETS_DIR='/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/Sdata'
[STARTUP] SOTE_DISCLESS='1'
[STARTUP] initialize_directdraw entry - checking routing gates
[ROUTE] SOTE_FORCE_SDL=1 detected - forcing SDL path
[ROUTE] forcing SDL path (disc-less)
[STARTUP] disc-less SDL loop begin
```

### SDL Initialization Failure
```
[ERROR] SDL video init failed: 1
```

### Title Sequence Attempt (X11 test)
```
[ERROR] SDL video init failed: x11 not available
[AUDIO] SDL audio init failed, continuing without audio
[LOOP] Enhanced SDL title sequence start, splash=800ms, title=5000ms
```

## Issues Identified

1. **SDL Video Subsystem:** Wine environment lacks proper SDL video backend support
   - SDL cannot initialize any video driver successfully
   - This prevents creation of windows and renderers
   
2. **Missing Expected Features:**
   - No VFS trace file created (`vfs.start.trace.jsonl`)
   - No input trace file created (`input.start.trace.json`)
   - No screenshots captured (`title_frame.bmp`, `start_frame.bmp`)
   - These features likely depend on successful SDL initialization

3. **Access Violation:** When SDL init fails with default settings, program crashes with NULL pointer dereference
   - Exception code: `c0000005` (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION)
   - Instruction pointer: `00000000` (attempted to execute from NULL)

## Conclusions

The enhanced PE32 executable successfully:
1. ✅ Detects and responds to environment variables
2. ✅ Routes to SDL path when `SOTE_FORCE_SDL=1`
3. ✅ Begins disc-less SDL loop
4. ✅ Attempts to initialize the enhanced title sequence with proper timing

However, the test cannot proceed further due to:
- ❌ SDL video subsystem initialization failure in Wine environment
- ❌ Lack of available SDL video backends (neither Windows GDI nor X11 work)
- ❌ Resulting crash when error handling path tries to clean up

## Recommendations

1. **For Wine Testing:**
   - Install SDL2 runtime libraries in Wine prefix
   - Configure Wine with proper display driver support
   - Consider using `winecfg` to set graphics settings
   - Try with `DISPLAY=:0` and actual X11 server running

2. **For Code Enhancement:**
   - Add better error handling for SDL init failure
   - Implement fallback to console/text mode when video fails
   - Add explicit SDL error messages using `SDL_GetError()`
   - Consider headless operation mode for testing

3. **Alternative Testing:**
   - Test on actual Windows system where SDL drivers are available
   - Use Windows VM with proper graphics support
   - Implement mock/stub SDL for testing logic flow

## Output Files Generated
- `/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/reports/runtime/wine.start.stderr.log` (2.3MB with debug traces)
- `/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/reports/runtime/wine.start.dummy2.log`
- `/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/reports/runtime/wine.start.final.log`

The skeleton implementation appears correct but cannot be fully validated due to SDL initialization issues in the Wine environment.
