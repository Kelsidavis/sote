# Wine Execution Test Summary

## Test Configuration
- **Executable**: `/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/build/bin/SOTE_RE.exe`
- **Hash**: `742c0a3395baa7e7ffe29475ed0c7f6fb739a7f807fd580a11ef050e7d70b031`
- **Format**: PE32 executable with 41 SDL2 functions imported
- **SDL2.dll**: Present (2,043,392 bytes)

## Environment Variables
- `SOTE_DISCLESS=1` - Disc-less mode enabled
- `SOTE_FORCE_SDL=1` - Force SDL rendering path
- `SOTE_ASSETS_DIR="/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/Sdata"` - Asset directory configured

## Execution Results

### Successful Components
1. **Wine Loading**: Executable loads successfully under Wine
2. **Environment Detection**: All environment variables properly detected
3. **SDL Routing**: Correctly routes to SDL path in disc-less mode
4. **Title Sequence Progress**: Progresses through splash and title phases
5. **Asset Loading**: Successfully transitions between splash and title ("boba.bmp")

### Issues Encountered
1. **SDL Video Initialization**: SDL cannot initialize video subsystem under Wine
   - Error: "SDL video init failed: software not available"
   - Various drivers attempted (x11, software, dummy) all fail
   
2. **Renderer Creation**: No SDL renderer available
   - Continuous "No renderer available" errors during draw operations
   - Title sequence continues but without visual output

3. **Input Synthesis**: Could not test menu navigation due to renderer issues
   - Application runs but cannot render frames
   - Input events would not be meaningful without visual feedback

## Log Analysis

### Key Log Messages
```
[STARTUP] main() entry - argc=1, argv=0035bdd0 (SDL2 signature)
[STARTUP] SOTE_ASSETS_DIR='/media/k/vbox1/Shadows/SOTE/Sdata'
[STARTUP] SOTE_DISCLESS='1'
[STARTUP] initialize_directdraw entry - checking routing gates
[ROUTE] SOTE_FORCE_SDL=1 detected - forcing SDL path
[ROUTE] forcing SDL path (disc-less)
[STARTUP] disc-less SDL loop begin
[ERROR] SDL video init failed: software not available
[AUDIO] SDL audio init failed, continuing without audio
[LOOP] Enhanced SDL title sequence start, splash=800ms, title=5000ms
[ROUTE] splash phase complete, transitioning to title
[ROUTE] title phase using: boba.bmp
```

### Expected Behaviors Confirmed
- ✅ SDL routing log: "[ROUTE] forcing SDL path (disc-less)"
- ✅ Startup sequence: "[STARTUP] disc-less SDL loop begin"
- ⚠️ VFS resolution: Not observed (likely due to renderer issues)
- ❌ Menu navigation: Could not test due to renderer failure

## Conclusions

The executable successfully loads and executes under Wine with proper environment variable detection and SDL routing. The main issue is SDL's inability to create a video context under Wine, which prevents rendering and meaningful input testing. 

The application logic appears correct:
1. Detects disc-less mode
2. Forces SDL path
3. Attempts title sequence with proper timing
4. Transitions between splash and title phases

To fully test menu navigation would require either:
1. Running on native Windows with real SDL2 support
2. Configuring Wine with better SDL2/graphics support
3. Adding a headless/test mode that logs input without requiring rendering
